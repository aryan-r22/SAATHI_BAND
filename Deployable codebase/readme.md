# Deployable code
## Team 17 - Silicon Labs Entreprenuership Challenge
### **Inter IIT Tech Meet 10.0**

### Description
This codebase implements stress, fall and sleep detection wrapped in a single script. Uses `../Fall detection` and `../Sleep_detection` for generating trained model files.  

### Running the code

- Install required dependencies
- Ensure that the input datafile is in the same format as `all.csv`.  
- Run `runner.py` to generate prediction files.
